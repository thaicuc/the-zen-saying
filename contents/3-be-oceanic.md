# Be Oceanic

If you belong to a crowd, make it more friendly and open.  
If you belong to a nation, make it more friendly and open.  
If you belong to a religion, make it more friendly and open.  
If you belong to a race, make it more friendly and open.  
Until it includes the whole existence.

Since the whole is always available,  
Be oceanic!
