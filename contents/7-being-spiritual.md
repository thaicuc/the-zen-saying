# Being Spiritual

In order to be truly free, you must desire to know the mystery more than you want
to feel good;  
Because if feeling good is your goal, then as soon as you feel better, you will
lose interest in what is more to this life.

This does not mean that feeling good or experiencing love and bliss is a bad thing.  
Given the choice, anyone would choose to feel bliss rather than sorrow.

It simply means that if this desire to feel good is stronger than the yearning to
see, know, and experience the mystery, then this desire will always be distorting
the perception of what is, while corrupting one's deepest integrity.
