# The Forest

Behind the sometimes seemingly random or even chaotic succession of events in our
lives as well as in the world, lies concealed the unfolding of a higher order and
purpose.

This is beautifully expressed in the Zen saying:  
"The snow falls, each flake in its appropriate place."

We can never understand this higher order through thinking about it;  
Because whatever we think about is content.  
Whereas, the higher order emanates from the formless realm of consciousness,  
From universal intelligence.

But we can glimpse it,  
And more than that, align ourselves with it.

When we go into a forest that has not been interfered with by man,  
Our thinking mind will see only disorder and chaos all around us.  
It won't even be able to differentiate between good and bad, or life and death anymore,  
since everywhere grows out of rotting and decaying matter.

Only if we are still enough inside and the noise of thinking subsides,  
Can we become aware that there is a hidden harmony here,  
A sacredness, a higher order in which everything has its perfect place,  
And everything could not be other than what it is and the way it is.

The mind is more comfortable in a landscape park;  
Because it has been planned through thought,  
It has not grown organically.

There is an order in the landscape park that the mind can understand;  
But in the forest, there is an incomprehensible order that looks like chaos to the mind.  
It is beyond the mental categories of good and bad.  
You cannot understand it through thought,  
But you can sense it when you let go of thought.

Become still and alert, and don't try to understand or explain.  
Only then, can you be aware of the sacredness of the forest.

As soon as you sense that hidden harmony, that sacredness,  
You realize that you are not separate from it,  
And you become a conscious participant in it.

In this way, nature can help you become realigned with the wholeness of life.
